## Introduction 🎯

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and software development. This course will guide you through the basics to advanced topics with practical examples.

---

## Why Learn C? 🤔

✅ **Foundation for Other Languages** – Many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python are influenced by C.  
✅ **High Performance** – C provides low-level memory manipulation, making it ideal for system programming.  
✅ **Portability** – C programs can run on different platforms with minimal changes.  
✅ **Used in Industry** – Many operating systems, databases, and game engines are written in C.

## Installation 🔧

To write and run C programs, you need a **C compiler** like **GCC**.

### Install GCC (Linux & macOS)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
```

## Install GCC (Windows)

- Download and install MinGW from mingw-w64.org
- Add MinGW to system PATH

## Running C Programs ▶️

After writing a C program, compile and execute it using the following commands:

```
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

Example:

```
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```
